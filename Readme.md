## Overview
The **ML-Enhanced Trading Engine** is a sophisticated trading system that leverages an ensemble of machine learning models with dynamic weight allocation. By combining Elastic Net, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting models, and utilizing PCA-driven feature reduction across 100+ market indicators, the system generates robust trading signals aimed at maximizing returns while minimizing risk.

## Key Features
- **Advanced Feature Engineering**: Generates over 100 technical indicators, including volatility metrics, momentum indicators, and volume analytics.
- **PCA Dimensionality Reduction**: Reduces feature space to 20 principal components, maintaining 95% of the variance to minimize noise.
- **Ensemble Architecture**: Integrates multiple ML models with dynamic weight reallocation based on rolling performance.
- **Bias Prevention**: Implements robust methodologies to prevent look-ahead bias in all data transformations and model training processes.

## Methodology

### Data Pipeline & Feature Engineering
- **Technical Indicators**: Generates 102 technical indicators encompassing:
  - **Price-Based Metrics**: Multiple timeframe moving averages.
  - **Advanced Volatility Measures**: Including Parkinson and Garman-Klass volatility estimates.
  - **Volume-Based Indicators**: Comprehensive volume analytics.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Applies PCA to reduce the feature set to 20 principal components, retaining 95% of the original variance.
- **Bias Prevention**: Ensures strict data segregation to prevent look-ahead bias during feature generation and transformation.

### Model Architecture
The trading engine employs three distinct machine learning models, each contributing uniquely to the ensemble.

#### Base Models
1. **Elastic Net**
   - **Regularization**: Combines L1 and L2 penalties.
   - **Performance**: Best individual performer with a Sharpe ratio of 1.01.
   - **Advantages**: Superior generalization capabilities.

2. **Random Forest**
   - **Structure**: Utilizes tree stumps (max_depth=1) to control complexity.
   - **Performance**: Sharpe ratio of 0.92.

3. **Gradient Boosting**
   - **Learning Rate**: Conservative learning rate of 0.01.
   - **Structure**: Implements tree stumps.
   - **Performance**: Sharpe ratio of 0.79.

#### Ensemble Implementation
- **Rolling Performance Evaluation**: Assesses model performance over a 60-day rolling window.
- **Weight Reallocation Frequency**: Adjusts model weights every 15 days based on recent performance.
- **Normalization**: Utilizes softmax-based weight normalization to ensure balanced contributions.
- **Dynamic Position Sizing**: Adapts position sizes based on model confidence levels.

### Training Methodology

#### Data Separation
- **Training Period**: November 2005 â€“ December 2020.
- **Testing Period**: January 2021 â€“ October 2024.

#### Bias Prevention Protocol
1. **Scaling**: `StandardScaler` fitted exclusively on training data.
2. **PCA Transformation**: Learned from the training set only.
3. **Model Optimization**: Parameters optimized using training data.
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Performed via cross-validation on training data.
5. **Testing**: Test set preserved for final unbiased evaluation.

### Performance Metrics
| Model              | Sharpe Ratio | Total Return | Max Drawdown |
|--------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Elastic Net**        | **1.01**         | **74.94%**       | **-18.46%**      |
| **Random Forest**      | 0.92         | 65.85%       | -20.88%      |
| **Gradient Boosting**  | 0.79         | 52.86%       | -22.35%      |


*The Elastic Net strategy outperforms individual models by achieving the highest Sharpe ratio and total return, while maintaining the lowest maximum drawdown, demonstrating enhanced robustness and effectiveness.*

## Technical Architecture
1. **Data Processing Pipeline**
   - **Feature Generation**: Extracts features from raw price data.
   - **Dimensionality Reduction**: Applies PCA for feature compression.
   - **Standardization**: Ensures consistent data scaling across features.

2. **Model Implementation**
   - **Elastic Net**: Implements combined L1/L2 regularization for feature selection and regularization.
   - **Random Forest**: Utilizes simple tree stumps to prevent overfitting.
   - **Gradient Boosting**: Employs a conservative learning rate to enhance model stability.

3. **Ensemble Strategy**
   - **Performance Evaluation**: Continuously monitors model performance over a rolling window.
   - **Dynamic Weighting**: Adjusts model weights periodically based on recent performance metrics.
   - **Position Sizing**: Allocates capital dynamically in response to model confidence.
